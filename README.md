# Image-Carousel
### An image carousel that showcases random images of different countries sourced from Unsplash.com
Every time the site loads random images from the specified countries are fetched from Unsplash.<br><br>
The images have a name at the bottom of the image indicating the name of the country which is derived from the <kbd>title</kbd> attribute in the image element in the HTML document.<br><br>
You can click on the <kbd>Previous</kbd> and <kbd>Next</kbd> buttons to go backwards or forwards.<br>

#### THe demo is live at **https://therealrajan.github.io/Image-Carousel/**
